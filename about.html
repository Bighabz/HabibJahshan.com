            <h2>The Background</h2>
            <p>I'm graduating from Cal State San Bernardino in May 2026 with a degree in cybersecurity. But I'm not waiting until graduation to start solving real problems.</p>

            <p>My path into tech started with security work — real security work. I've worked as a SOC analyst monitoring threats, a security officer protecting physical assets, and founded the Cybersecurity Club at CSUSB where I mentor students on everything from CompTIA certifications to breaking into the industry.</p>

            <p>I hold CompTIA A+, Security+, and ISC2 CC certifications. I received a Black Hat scholarship for my work in the field. And I'm currently an AI research intern on the AI Horizon Project, working on cutting-edge applications of artificial intelligence.</p>

            <h2>Why AI Automation for Small Business?</h2>
            <p>I became a new father recently. That changes everything. You start thinking differently about money, time, and what really matters.</p>

            <p>I saw friends and family running small businesses — salons, barbershops, auto detailing, restaurants — working 60-80 hour weeks. They were good at their craft but drowning in admin work: missed calls, manual appointment scheduling, chasing customers for reviews, trying to get people to come back.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, I was working with AI models in my research that could handle conversations, understand context, and automate repetitive tasks. The disconnect was obvious: the people who needed this technology the most had no idea it existed or how to use it.</p>

            <p>So I started building. Not academic research projects — practical systems that solve real problems for real businesses.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h2>The Mission</h2>
            <p><strong>Help small business owners get their time back.</strong></p>
            <p>Not by selling them software they'll never use. Not by making them tech experts. But by building systems that work in the background — answering calls, following up with customers, booking appointments, requesting reviews — so they can focus on what they're actually good at.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
            <h2>How Security Background Helps</h2>
            <p>My cybersecurity training isn't just a credential — it shapes how I build everything.</p>

            <p><strong>Data security:</strong> Your customer data is valuable. I build systems that protect it. No leaks, no breaches, no shortcuts.</p>

            <p><strong>System reliability:</strong> A security mindset means thinking about failure modes. What happens if the AI breaks? If the SMS service goes down? I build redundancy and monitoring into everything.</p>

            <p><strong>Privacy first:</strong> I don't sell data. I don't share customer information. What happens in your business stays in your business.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
            <h2>What I Actually Do</h2>
            <p>I build three things:</p>

            <p><strong>1. Systems that capture leads you're currently losing.</strong> Voice bots that answer calls 24/7. Chatbots that respond to texts instantly. You stop missing revenue from after-hours inquiries.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Systems that bring customers back.</strong> Automated follow-ups that feel personal. Review requests at the perfect time. Win-back campaigns for dormant customers. You stop being a one-time business.</p>

            <p><strong>3. Websites that actually work.</strong> Not bloated WordPress sites that take 10 seconds to load. Fast, clean, mobile-friendly sites with booking built-in. Your business looks professional because it is.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
            <p>I'm not building this to get acquired by Google or raise venture capital. I'm building it because I need it to work.</p>

            <p>I'm a new dad trying to build financial stability for my family. That means I can't sell you something that doesn't deliver ROI. I can't over-promise and under-deliver. I can't build something that breaks after three months.</p>

            <p>My reputation in the cybersecurity community, my research work, and my future career all depend on building things that actually work. That alignment matters.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h2>The Difference</h2>
            <p><strong>Most AI automation companies are selling to VPs at Fortune 500s.</strong> They charge $50k for implementation and require a team of engineers to maintain it.</p>
            <p><strong>I'm building for the salon owner who's tired of missing calls.</strong> The mechanic who wants customers to come back for oil changes. The restaurant owner who needs more regulars. Real people with real businesses who can't afford to waste $200/month on something that doesn't work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="story-section">
            <h2>What You Should Know</h2>
            <p><strong>I'm honest about limitations.</strong> AI isn't magic. It can't replace human judgment for complex situations. But for repetitive tasks? It's incredible.</p>

            <p><strong>I start small.</strong> No $10k upfront contracts. We build one piece, prove it works, then expand. You see ROI before spending serious money.</p>

            <p><strong>I'm local.</strong> Based in Southern California. I can meet in person, understand your business, and build something that actually fits.</p>
